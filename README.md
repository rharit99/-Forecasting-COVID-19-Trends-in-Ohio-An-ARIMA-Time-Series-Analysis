ðŸ©º Forecasting COVID-19 Trends in Ohio: An ARIMA Time Series Analysis

 
# COVID-19 Case Trends Forecast in Ohio Using ARIMA Models

## Project Overview

In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, this project aims to analyze and predict the course of the virus's spread in Ohio. By leveraging ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) models, a sophisticated time series analysis technique, we delve into the pandemic's dynamics within the state.

### Objectives:
- **Data Preparation**: Compile daily COVID-19 case data for Ohio, ensuring it's clean and analysis-ready.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Apply ARIMA modeling to discover the best parameter combinations that reflect the data's trends accurately.
- **Forecasting**: Produce forecasts that outline possible future trends in COVID-19 cases in Ohio, complete with prediction intervals for enhanced public health planning.

## Key Outcomes

- Determined the optimal ARIMA model configuration for Ohio's COVID-19 case data.
- Provided forecasts for future case trends, aiding in anticipation and planning.
- Deepened the understanding of time series forecasting and its relevance to public health analytics.

## Impact

This project illustrates the value of statistical models in supporting the management of pandemic responses. Forecasting COVID-19 trends can significantly influence the decision-making process among health officials and policymakers, leading to more strategic and informed actions.

### Contributions to Public Health:
- The project's forecasts offer a basis for proactive measures in public health planning.
- Demonstrates ARIMA models' efficacy in processing and predicting trends from complex epidemiological data, setting the stage for future advancements in health analytics.
